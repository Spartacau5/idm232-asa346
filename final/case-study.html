                    <h4> Overview </h4>
                    <p class="description"> This project is a web-app cooking recipebook which enables users to learn how to cook delicious food easily. </p>
                </div>

                    <h4> Context And Challenge </h4>
                    <p class="description"> The first thought that struck me when I was deciding on what I wanted to do for my project was “What’s a clear problem
                    in my life, and what’s a solution that could help towards it?”. As a college student it isn’t an uncommon problem to be
                    spending too much money on ordering food, it’s a pattern that’s observable in large numbers of the student population,
                    and even though cooking your own meals is the obvious solution many of us still aren’t up to it. </p>   
                    <p class="description"> So keeping in mind there are numerous websites with dozens of recipes, I set out to personalize one to cater to my own
                    food needs. Dishes that were easy to cook, could be prepped ahead and stored, that had filling and nutritious portions
                    and a way to sort them by meal of the day, breakfast lunch and dinner. That way I could sort my meals based on time of
                    the day, make sure I’m eating well and timing myself between meals and so on. </p>
                    <p class="description"> So far the metrics that would define the success of the project at the current stage is solely limited to hands-on user
                    survey data. Since the problem that this project seeks to solve is one that is ubiquitous among college aged students, I
                    asked my friends for constant feedback during the development process to better quantify what the target audience’s
                    specific needs are. </p>
                    <p class="description"> Tangible goals so far would be to get the site online and market it to reach a consistent daily user-base, then proceed
                    to generate Ad-revenue off it to make the domain self-sustaining and cover the sunk costs of getting it up and running.
                    Future development options could include an app as well as more filters and sorting options based on cuisine,
                    Vegan/Vegetarian options, etc.

                    <h4> The Solution </h4>
                    <p class="description"> <a href="index.php" class="logo-link"> This is Grandma’s Pantry. </a>  My design goal was simple, people eat with their eyes and this is a site for food. The real
                    star had to be the food, often when we try to decide what to order on UberEats or Grubhub we tend to go back and forth
                    before we make our decision, it’s only natural that we tend to do the same when we’re trying to decide what to cook. The
                    food had to be showcased boldly and centrally so that the user could clearly see what the end result of their efforts
                    (with the cooking time displayed below helping them gauge that accurately) would be and would thus be inclined to either
                    browse or make their decision once something really catches their eye. </p>

                <div class="ingheader">
                    <h4> The Results </h4>
                    <p class="description"> So far I do believe that the project was a success as the userbase that I surveyed it with was extremely receptive and
                    supportive during development. By the time the final project was completed, it had been tailor-made to suit the wider
                    range of their specific needs.
                    Though the quantitative data is limited as I could only survey so many people, their feedback resulted in a wealth of
                    qualitative data, indexed by user, to be used in the development process.
