                        <p class="description">Tonightʼs variation on the beloved Italian-American dish gets its “devilish” heat from Calabrian chile paste, mixed
                            into a tangy-sweet tomato sauce. It perfectly coats shrimp, cabbage, and lumaca rigata pasta. A garnish of sliced
                            almonds finishes the dish with contrasting crunch. </p>

                                    1. Fill a medium pot with water; add a big pinch of salt and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh
                                    produce. Cut out and discard the core of the cabbage; thinly slice the leaves. Peel and roughly chop the garlic.

                            <div class="steps">

                                    2. Pat the shrimp dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper. In a medium pan, heat a drizzle of olive
                                    oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned shrimp; cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until
                                    opaque and cooked through. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a plate. Set aside in a
                                    warm place.
                            </div>

                                    3. Add the sliced cabbage to the pan of reserved fond; season with salt and pepper. (If the pan seems dry, add a
                                    drizzle of olive oil.) Cook on mediumhigh, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened.
                                    Add the verjus and 1/4 cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up
                                    any fond, 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cabbage has softened and the water has cooked off. Transfer to the plate
                                    of cooked shrimp. Wipe out the pan.
                            
                            
                            </div>

                                    4. While the cabbage cooks, add the pasta to the pot of boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, 9 to 11
                                    minutes, or until al dente (still slightly firm to the bite). Reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water,
                                    drain thoroughly.

                                    5. While the pasta cooks, in the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the
                                    chopped garlic; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until
                                    softened and fragrant. Add the tomato sauce, 1/3 cup of water, and as much of the chile paste as you’d like,
                                    depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to
                                    5 minutes, or until thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

                                Serve your dish:

                                    6. Add the cooked pasta, cooked shrimp and cabbage, and half the reserved pasta cooking water to the pan. Cook,
                                    stirring vigorously, 1 to 2 minutes, or until coated. (If the sauce seems dry, gradually add the remaining pasta
                                    cooking water to achieve your desired consistency.) Turn off the heat; stir in the crème fraîche until
                                    thoroughly combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Top the finished pasta with the almonds and a drizzle
                                    of olive oil. Enjoy!
